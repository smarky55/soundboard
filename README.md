# Soundboard
A soundboard web app designed to load all required data from a user specified location, either a local file on the user's machine or a file published somewhere else on the web.

## Usage
### Creating archives manually
Use [ARX](https://github.com/smarky55/Arx) to save all your files!

Format TBD.

## Contributing
Web assets are isolated on the `gh-pages` branch. Any changes that affect the user facing portion of this project should be made against that branch (or a `pages-dev` branch, should one exist). Changes to the `gh-pages` branch should be merged back into `master` such that it serves as a master overview of all project files.

Any changes to files that should not be accessible from the web should be made against the 'develop' or 'master' branches.
